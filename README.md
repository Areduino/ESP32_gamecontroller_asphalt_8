# ESP32 Bluetooth HID Game Controller

## Overview
This project turns an **ESP32** into a **Bluetooth HID game controller** that can send joystick movements and button presses to a connected device. It works with PC, Android, and potentially games like **Asphalt 8**.

## Features
- üì° **Bluetooth HID support** (mimics a standard game controller).
- üéÆ **Joystick inputs** (X/Y axis for movement).
- üîò **Single button functionality** (e.g., action button).
- üöÄ **Lightweight & customizable** for different games.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 DevKit V1** board
- **Analog joystick module** (connected to GPIO34/35)
- **Button** (connected to GPIO25)
- **Arduino IDE** (for programming)
- **ESP32 BLE HID Library**

## Installation & Setup
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the **ESP32 BLE Arduino library** installed:
1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **Library Manager** (`Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`).
3. Search for **"ESP32 BLE HID"** and install it.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Flashing the Code
1. Connect the ESP32 via USB to your PC.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and **upload the game controller code**.
3. Hold the **BOOT button** while flashing if needed.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pairing the ESP32
1. Open Bluetooth settings on your **PC or Android device**.
2. Search for `"ESP32_GameController"` and **pair**.
3. Use a **game controller tester** to verify input responses.

## Usage
- **Move the joystick** to send X/Y axis data.
- **Press the button** to activate an in-game action.
- **Modify the code** for extra buttons or enhanced features.

## Future Enhancements
üîπ Add **multiple buttons** for more controls  
üîπ Implement **BLE HID keyboard/mouse mode**  
üîπ Improve **compatibility with Asphalt 8**
